The only thing I love more than self-development is meeting a new client and figuring out together how we can create sustainable change for them. Working as a freelance coach exposes me to many types of people from all sorts of professions.

## Credentials

I am a certified transformative coach trained by Coach Masters Academy in Singapore. I study a BA in public administration with specialty in project management, HR and executive management on the side. My work experience includes personel management, recruitment, training, being a hotel receptionist and chairman of boards.

## Coaching for Action

First I help you gain awareness and clarity about what you want to change, to make a sustainable change we then create action plans and design accountability for you to reach you goals.

I believe it's better to be an original because it's worth more than a copy :)
