The only thing I love more than self-development is meeting a new client and figuring out together how we can create sustainable change for them. Working as a freelance coach exposes me to many types of people from all sorts of professions. I've worked with CEOs and professional athletes to stay-at-home moms and couples.

## Credentials

I am a certified transformative coach trained by Coach Masters Academy in Singapore. I study a BA in public administration with specialty in project management, HR and executive management on the side - next to getting certified as a project manager with Google. My work experience includes personel management, recruitment, training, being a hotel receptionist and chairman of boards.

## Coaching for Action

I coach people who desire to enhance focus on goals, motivation and awareness to gain sustainable changes and I assist in creating better relations. The transformative coaching approach is about helping the client gain a heightened awareness, so that they will be able to reach better solutions on their own.

## &#xA;Executive Coaching&#xA;

A key element is the ability the gain a heightened awareness as an executive. The statement ‘leaders are readers’ translates into leaders or executives, are more willing and receptive to new ways of thinking and gathering knowledge. They themselves are more demanding in the desire to perform better. To do that they have to develop a more resilient and agile leadership. Leadership development is personal development.

Transformative coaching will help the executive gain better self-awareness. Some of the challenges transformative coaching can be helpful with are:
\- As an executive you are likely to have insecurities about corporate decisions for instance whether an employee is performing or functioning to the best of their abilities in their team.
\- There could be self-doubts concerning the executive’s own role, his/her decision-making powers or if they themselves are the right match for the tasks and responsibilities given.
\- There could be strategic scenarios the executive would like to explore to clarify pros and cons. Personal issues can create a barrier in the corporate life. Here transformative coaching can be of help and gain the client clarity and a better understanding of what motivates and drives people around them.
\- Something as simple as exploring how to communicate differently with your employees – or spouse for that matter – could make all the difference on everyday basis.

How could transformative coaching be applied to coaching executives in the workplace?
On a practical level it would be easy and highly beneficial to do executive management training led by a trained coach. As mentioned earlier, change comes from the leaders. Implementing transformative coaching as a tool when doing employee development planning, would lead to an entirely different type of conversation and most likely inspire more personal ownership for employee tasks ahead in the future.



## Enneagram

I am very passionate about the Enneagram approach and I plan on becoming a practitioner within the next year. The Enneagram is a nine-sided figure used in a particular system of analysis to represent the spectrum of possible personality types. The Enneagram helps us understand how people react to stress. By describing how each Enneatype adapts and responds to both stressful and supportive situations, the Enneagram shows opportunities for personal development and provides a foundation for the understanding of others. It can be a great tool to navigate and improve one's human relations.

I believe it's better to be an original because it's worth more than a copy :)

And remember; it's YOUR life - level up!
