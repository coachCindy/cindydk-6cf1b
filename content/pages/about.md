The only thing I love more than self-development is meeting a new client and figuring out together how we can create sustainable change for them. Working on a freelance coach basis exposes me to many types of people from all sorts of professions.

## Credentials

I am a certified transformative coach trained by Coach Masters Academy in Singapore. I study a BA in public administration with specialty in project management, HR and executive management on the side. My work experience includes personel management, recruitment, training, being a hotel receptionist and chairman of boards etc. 

## Coaching for Action

I believe it's better to be an original because it's worth more than a copy. By gaining awareness and clarity you can create action plans and design accountability on how to reach your goals.
