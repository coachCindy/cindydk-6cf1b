The only thing I love more than self-development is meeting a new client and figuring out together how we can create sustainable change for them. Working as a freelance coach exposes me to many types of people from all sorts of professions.

## Credentials

I am a certified transformative coach trained by Coach Masters Academy in Singapore. I study a BA in public administration with specialty in project management, HR and executive management on the side - next to getting certified as a project manager with Google. My work experience includes personel management, recruitment, training, being a hotel receptionist and chairman of boards.

## Coaching for Action

First I help you gain awareness and clarity about what you want to change, then to make a sustainable change we create action plans and design accountability for you to reach your goals.

## Enneagram

I am very passionate about the Enneagram approach and I plan on becoming a practitioner within the next year. The Enneagram is a nine-sided figure used in a particular system of analysis to represent the spectrum of possible personality types. The Enneagram helps us understand how people react to stress. By describing how each Enneatype adapts and responds to both stressful and supportive situations, the Enneagram shows opportunities for personal development and provides a foundation for the understanding of others. It can be a great tool to navigate and improve one's human relations.

I believe it's better to be an original because it's worth more than a copy :)
