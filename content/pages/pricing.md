      ## Pricing


      Depends on you and your goals and whether you want an intensive
      collaboration with a short time frame or stretched across weeks and
      months. Other options could be coaching for your team at work or you and
      your partner wanting relationship coaching.


      After the free 30-minute call I will be able to provide you with ballpark
      pricing, if you choose more than 1 conversation I will send you a detailed
      proposal once we discuss the details.
